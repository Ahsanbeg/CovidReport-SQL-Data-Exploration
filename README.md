# CovidReport-SQL-Data-Exploration


The SQL Data Exploration Project on Covid death and vaccination Data involves analyzing and querying a dataset that contains information about Covid deaths and vaccinations. The goal of the project is to explore the data and draw insights by using SQL queries to extract relevant information. The dataset includes information such as country, date, Covid deaths, and vaccinations.

Using SQL, the project involves exploring the data by answering questions such as which countries have the highest number of Covid deaths or vaccinations, how has the vaccination rate changed over time, and what is the correlation between Covid deaths and vaccinations. The project also involves visualizing the data using SQL and tools like Tableau to provide a more meaningful understanding of the trends and patterns in the data. Overall, the SQL Data Exploration Project provides a practical application of SQL skills to extract insights from real-world data related to Covid-19.
